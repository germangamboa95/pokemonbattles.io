#Pokemon battle game
The aim of this project is to practice creating a turn-based fighting game using jQuery.
The game will be working on the Pokemon API which is an open API that helps beginners. 


## Dev log

### Day One
 
Pretty good day. All the basic functionality is complete. This is my first time using jQuery. It makes things easier to an extent. I spent 30min looking for a bug in one of my query selectors only to discover the element was created incorrectly.
    ` class=health` instead of `class="health"`
    I keep latching on to class selectors and I keep using them to track state. I need to fix that. 

## Todo log
* [] Decouple state from class attribute.
* [] Add fight next opponent functionality 
* [] Add a lose state. 
* [] Add a win fight state and a win all state. 

## Technologies used
* jQuery for DOM manipulation. 
* Pokemon API.
